/*
It is preety much similiar to the question 78. Subsets.
The only difference is that we have to remove the duplicates from the result.
So, what i did is that after generating the subset i sorted the result vector
After sorting the result vector
we first do unique(result.begin(),result.end()) which doesnt not remove the duplicates but pushes them to the end of the vector and returns a pointer to the first duplicate element
ex: [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5] after unique() it becomes [1,2,3,4,5,2,3,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5] and returns a pointer to the 2 which is the first duplicate element
then we do result.erase(unique(result.begin(),result.end()),result.end()) which removes the duplicates from th epointer returned by unique() to the end of the vector.

Now i dont know why we have to sort the input vector but it doesnt work without sorting the input vector and rule is if it works dont touch it ðŸ˜….
